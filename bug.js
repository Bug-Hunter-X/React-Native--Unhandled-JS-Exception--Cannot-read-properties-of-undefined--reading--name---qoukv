This error occurs when you try to access a state variable or prop before it has been initialized.  This commonly happens when using asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API, where the component renders before the data has been loaded.

```javascript
// Incorrect:
function MyComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  return (
    <Text>{data.name}</Text> // Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'name')
  );
}
```

This will throw an error because `data` is initially `null` and the component tries to access `data.name` before the fetch request completes.
